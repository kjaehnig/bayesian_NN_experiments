# bayesian_NN_experiments
Repository for various experiments with Bayesian neural networks in TensorFlow


## Quick list of projects

### Bayesian convolutional neural network classifier using Intel images

#### Current best validation accuracy: ~83%

#### Bayesian NN can output probability intervals, illustrating how sure/unsure the model is of a classification.
#### A very sure classification of an image of a sea.

### Bayesian dense neural network classifier using Intel images

#### Still work in progress.
